        <p class="toc">Knowing these terms will come in handy as you prepare names for temple work.</p>
        <p><span class="term">Closest living relative.</span> For purposes of reserving temple names, <em>closest living relative</em> is defined as an undivorced spouse (the spouse to whom the individual was married when he or she died), an adult child, a parent, or a sibling.

        <p><span class="term">Family Ordinance Request (FOR).</span> The paper you print after reserving ordinances to take to the temple to have ordinance cards printed.
        </p>
        <p><span class="term">Opportunities.</span> Starting with you, FamilySearch scans back as far as your great–great–grandparents, also looking at each of their spouses, their children, and their children’s spouses. If any of these individuals are missing temple ordinances, their names appear here—as possible opportunities for temple service.</p>
        <p>Before reserving a name on your opportunities list, you'll want to <a href="prepare_names.html">verify basic information</a> and also <a href="resolve_duplicates.html">check for duplicates</a>.</p>
        <p><span class="term">Qualify.</span> Term used to refer to making sure that a name is ready for temple work.
        </p>
        <p><span class="term">Reserve.</span> Select a name in Family Tree and add it to your temple list.
        </p>
        <p><span class="term">Share.</span> Give your reserved names to others so they can help with temple work.
